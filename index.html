                <p>My name is Hieu Vu and the picture above I took with my daughter and her cousin. 
                I'm currently trying to complete my bachelor's degree at PSU. Although I graduated with a computer science degree in Vietnam,
                 because I feel there are many things I have to learn more to adapt my current situation. 
                 Right now I'm wondering about my approach to computer science, I'm wondering about Data Mining,
                  Self-driving or Artificial Intelligence. Looking forward to hearing from you.
                I am very impressed with open-ai, especially with Chat-gpt. I did have a good time to play with it, 
                I don't know if you agree with me that, one day the AI will replace us especially in the field
                 of Information Technology? Looking forward to hearing from you in the contact-feedback section.</p></div></div>
